# Online_Digital_Lib
This project is based on an online book issuing system from home for college students
This project aimed at providing easy access to books during Covid Lockdown where students could easily issue books from the website from anywhere.
The main projects has two parts student side and admin side ,where student side had access to the available books and can issue books from home , while the admin side had functionality to set the number of days the book could be issued and also put fine if there is a delay in returning the issued books.
All the system has been connected to the databse system.
